These are joke systemd logos meant to be printed onto a black t-shirt.
The original systemd logo was taken from [https://brand.systemd.io/](https://brand.systemd.io/).

## Can You Recommend a Print Shop?
- I have tried out [https://printplanet.de/](https://printplanet.de/) and unfortunately they fuck it up sometimes.
I don't know why it happens but sometimes (two out of four orders) they replace the transparent background from the
[source file](https://gitlab.com/BoostCookie/systemd-tshirtd/-/jobs/artifacts/main/raw/tshirtd.origlogo.transparent.svg?job=typst-compile)
with complete black (RGB 0, 0, 0).

- Apart from that I have tried out [https://www.shirtinator.de](https://www.shirtinator.de), but only for a different logo and a white T-shirt.

Let me know if you find a good print shop with good quality T-shirts and good handling of transparent backgrounds.
